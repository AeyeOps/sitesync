# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Preferred: open a private security advisory on GitHub:
- https://github.com/AeyeOps/sitesync/security/advisories/new

If you cannot use GitHub security advisories, contact the maintainers privately.
